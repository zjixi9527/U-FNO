 Intelligent Solution of Three Dimensional Seismic Wavefields in Complex Sites Based on U-shaped Fourier Neural Operator
 
Abstract: Regional three dimensional seismic wavefield simulation is of great significance for seismic design, fortification, and post-earthquake disaster relief. However, numerical simulation methods involve enormous computational cost and long runtime; although deep learning can accelerate simulations, its performance on complex wave-propagation problems is limited by spectral bias, resulting in insufficient representation of local fine-scale details. To address these challenges, this study proposes a U-shaped Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO)-based intelligent solver for 3D seismic wavefields, enabling rapid simulation for different source locations in a regional complex site. To model seismic wave propagation with multi-frequency coupling and complex physical processes, the proposed U-FNO combines the global representation capability of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) in the frequency domain with the local feature extraction capability of a U-Net encoder–decoder. The Fourier layers efficiently learn the operator mapping from source locations to ground-surface wavefield responses in the frequency domain, capturing global characteristics of multi-frequency-coupled wavefields. Meanwhile, the encoder applies multi-layer convolutions and down-sampling to extract high-dimensional features from ground-surface wavefields, and the decoder reconstructs the wavefield response through up-sampling. With skip connections, local spatial details are preserved and the expressive capacity for complex wave-propagation patterns is enhanced, thereby establishing an efficient U-FNO-based wavefield solver. Using spectral-element method simulations, a database of three-component ground-surface seismic wavefields generated by point sources at different locations on a specific fault plane under realistic complex site conditions is constructed to train and validate the U-FNO model. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently and accurately predict 3D seismic wavefields for different source locations in complex sites, providing an intelligent and high-performance approach for regional site engineering seismic analysis.
